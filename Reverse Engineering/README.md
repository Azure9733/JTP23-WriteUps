# keygenme-py

1) In the question there is a python code linked to the question.
2) I then analysed the python code, which uses hashlib to deal with hexadecimal text.
3) A part of the flag has been given. They flag has been split into 3 parts, 2 static parts and 1 dynamic part which we need to decipher.
4) The dynamic part has been stored in an array called key. The array has the dynamic flag in a scrambled order.
5) I then logged into the UDF with the username 'ANDERSON' (which was given) sha256 with hashlib, which contains the key.
6)
