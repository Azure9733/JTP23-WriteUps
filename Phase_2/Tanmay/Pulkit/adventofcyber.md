# Task 7

## Solution
I used the given list of commands to first list the employee directory. I pretended to be one of the employees, following which I asked the chatbot for McGreedy's personal email address, which it readily gave. Then, I elevated privileges by posing as McGreedy and offering the email, thus gaining the password to the IT room door.

## Flag
`Purple Snow`


# Task 8

## Solution
I visually observed the last serial number to get the number of packets captured and thanks to a coulmn field it was east to tell that the IP address 10.10.1.4 sent significantly higher traffic. I then used the idxmax() function to get the most frequent protocol ICMP. 

# Task 9

## Solution
This was fairly guided. I generated a 3-character wordlist using crunch and bruteforced the php page using hydra to reveal the password and capture the flag before running out of free attackbox time :(

## Password
`6F5`
