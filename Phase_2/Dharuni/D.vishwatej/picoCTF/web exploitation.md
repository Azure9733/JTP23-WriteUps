# CAAS
## GOAL
Make a request to the following URL to cowsay your message:

`https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}`

### WRITE UP:-

The command `$ curl` is used as a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols.

**Cowsay** is a program that generates ASCII art pictures of a cow with a message.

Thus we type `$ curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/hi_vishwa;ls" `

We find the following files inside

![image](https://github.com/vishwatejD/picoCTF/assets/141154035/8d3fcd2e-ddea-4654-aff5-9f3e5afcdcea)

We require the flag file thus we run cat command for the falg.txt file

`$ curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}; cat falg.txt"`

We get the flag as 
**picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}**

# FORBIDDEN PATHS
## GOAL

Can you get the flag? Here's the website. We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

### WRITEUP:-

If we try to access the file it shows not authorised.
Thus we use the relative path or path traversal.

The sequence `../` is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure.

The four consecutive ../ sequences step up from /html to the filesystem root, thus the file can be read
  
  `../../../../flag.txt`

Thus by clicking read we get the flag as 

**picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}**

# LOCAL AUTHORITY
## GOAL 
Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.
http://saturn.picoctf.net:59126/

### WRITE UP
First we inspect the site for any information using `ctrl+shift+I`
We only find the style.css file inside.
We  then try to login in using a random username and password. But we get log in failed.

Now if we check the source code. we find _**login.php**_ and _**secure.js**_ inside.

And inside secure.js we find the password and the username.

If we use this credentials to login once again we get the final flag.

FLAG:- picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}
