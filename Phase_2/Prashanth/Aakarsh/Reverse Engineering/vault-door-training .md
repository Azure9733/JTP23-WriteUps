### Approach Used
After downloading and opening the java file in a compiler we can start understanding the code.

Here we can see in the very last line of the code there is a command 'return password.equals' which meaans this will give us the password in return. So we will just copy the password written and change it to picoCTF format and enter it in our question.

### Flag
> picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_be8d9806f18}
### Solution
We could have easily solved this problem if we wouldn't have given the password in the source file itself. So even if our source file gets stolen our doors will still remain locked.
