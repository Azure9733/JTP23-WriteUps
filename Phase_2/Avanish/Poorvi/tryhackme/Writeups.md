DAY 1:

In this task, we learnt about how an AI's vulnerabilities can be exploited. If we ask the right questions, we can get the bot to leak information. Hence Though it's exciting, chatbot technology still has a long way to go. Like many parts of cyber security, it's always changing as both security measures and tricks to beat them keep evolving together.


DAY 2:

In this task, we learn about Python and its libraries like Pandas, DataFrame and Matpltlib and using them to analyse packet capture using Jupyter notebook.


DAY 3:

In this task, we learn how to brute force using hydra. Since a single pin can have millions of possible combinations, it impossible to manually insert numbers to crack the code. So instead we create a password list using another tool Crunch and use the passwords file along with hydra which bruteforces all the passwords into the link we provide and tells us when its gotten a hit.

DAY 6:

In this task, we leanr about buffer overlow vulnerability. In the given game we are supposed to get enough coins to buy a star which gives us the flag. The star requires 10000 coins which makes the game unwinnable practically. We can use one coin to change our name and this is where we get an opportuniy to attack. If we change the name to something big enough, the stack overflows into the next memory allocated to coins and get how many ever coins we wish.

There is also the concept of little endianness. Integers in C++ are stored in a very particular way in memory. First, integers have a fixed memory space of 4 bytes, as seen in the debug panel. Secondly, an integer's bytes are stored in reverse order in most desktop machines. This is known as the little-endian byte order.

Finally the challenege of the rigged star, where the star gets replaced by another object whenever we buy it can again be solved using buffer overflow, where we can make the name large enough to fill the memory for all slots before the inventory memory and then enter the value we need 'd' which was generally getting replaced by 'e' due to the rig and give the star to the tree.


DAY 8:

In this challenege, we use the FTK imager which is a forensics tool that allows forensic specialists to acquire computer data and perform analysis without affecting the original evidence, preserving its authenticity, integrity, and validity for presentation during a trial in a court of law. We can analyse malware infected system to retrive deleted files which can trace us back to the perpetrator. It clearly shows which files have been deleted and we get hidden information from it. Additionally, the SHA hash value option in the imager can  verify the integrity of a drive/image.
