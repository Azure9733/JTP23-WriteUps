## keygenme-py

After opening the python file,I noticed the username and the half written flag.
\
`import hashlib`
\
`hashlib.sha256(b"SCHOFIELD").hexdigest()`


got this
*66b8e54339dc8b7ff42eb6ea4d95561c67ad1192de710700b57c98e47c8af4b5*
\
\
then, used 
`key_part_dynamic1_trial` to add the array elements in the order specified. 



flag: **picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_e584b363}**

Opened the file and found that its rot47

went to a rot47 decoder and got the key right away

flag: **picoCTF{1|\/|_4_p34|\|ut_502b984b}**
