## tunn3l v1s10n

Opened the attached file and it displayed nothing in the text editor. Then, i openend it in a hex editor. I opened a random image in the hex editor as well to compare the hex codes.
Found out that the tunnel vision file is written in a wrong format, so, i did the required changes while referring to the other images's hex
