# miniRSA

1) According to the question there is an RSA key given which I opened up on my notepad application.
2) I analyzed it and saw that each key was a part of the main RSA key which needed to be decoded
3) Using the website https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher I decoded the key and the required flag came.
