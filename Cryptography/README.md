# miniRSA

1) According to the question there is an RSA key given which I opened up on my notepad application.
2) I analyzed it and saw that each key was a part of the main RSA key which needed to be decoded
3) Using the website https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher I decoded the key and the required flag came.

  # Flag

# basic-mod1

1) According to the question, there is a list of numbers that are given. We need to apply mod 37 to find the key using given data.
2) I then put the list onto a python code and then used a decryption method to unscramble the data to get the flag

3) the required key then came after running the code
